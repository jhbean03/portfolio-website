            <p>
            As stated above, I am currently working on getting my undergraduate degree (B.S.) in computer science and mathematics at THE Ohio State University, 
            with a planned graduation in May 2026. With this being said, I have learned a great deal from my time completing coursework and conducting research at Ohio State. 
            I am deeply passionate about the ever-evolving field of software and web development; I am most intrigued in learning robust technologies that allow for more
            accessible software.
            </p>
            <p>
            I also have a deep interest in developing pedagogical methods to streamline education within mathematics, and I hope to start development on projects which will 
            provide more targeted tools to students who may not have access to many resources for learning math in general. Some of my other hobbies I enjoy during my free 
            time are trying new and delicious food, weightlifting, running, playing video games, and reading. Feel free to look at some of the projects I have been working 
            on and contact me with the info included on my resume!
